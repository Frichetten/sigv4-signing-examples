# sigv4-signing-examples

This repo contains the original SIGv4 signing examples in Python from the AWS documentation. At some point they were removed, which is a shame as they were super useful for packaging exploits into a single script. 

Major thank you to Chaz Schlarp for finding them for me on the [Wayback Machine](https://web.archive.org/web/20211120203616mp_/https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/sigv4-signed-request-examples.html)!
